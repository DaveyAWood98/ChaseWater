                        <p>Chasewater Heaths station is located on the A5190 Lichfield – Cannock Road, immediately adjacent to the new Burntwood Bypass

                            The station has a gift and book shop, male, female and disabled toilets and an externally franchised cafe, which is open 7 days a week; hot and cold food is served.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The track between Chasewater Heaths and Norton Lakeside has recently been relaid, which has eased the entry curve and allowed the installation of points for the loop and bay/goods yard, which should be completed in the near future.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With all of the station lamp posts now painted, the next task to finalise the wiring and the fitting of the lamps can now proceed. In addition, a fund has been set up to allow the construction of a station canopy along the through platform side of the building. This is funded principally from gift shop sales.</p>

                        <p>n the 1860’s with the coming of the Railway Age, a great number of collieries were in production all over Cannock Chase, and sought this new form of rapid movement for their products. The Cannock Chase &amp; Wolverhampton Railway (CC &amp; WR) deposited Parliamentary plans (we have the originals) for a railway from the north side of Chasewater to a junction with the Great Western Railway just to the north of Wolverhampton Low Level. However, the only section built was that which we now lease, which conjoined along the Reservoir’s south shore with the Midland Railway and the London & North Western Railway.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, the CC &amp; WR forms only part of our present railway. The first five-eighths of a mile from our Brownhills West terminus were constructed by the Midland Railway. This section included exchange sidings, where the Colliery Company locomotives deposited loaded trains for onward haulage by the main line Companies, and the collection of empty wagons for refilling.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The line used to be busy with a wonderful mixture of Midland Railway and London and North Western Railway locomotives, alongside their industrial cousins.</p>
